# AutoSyncNotability

# I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE/LOSS OF YOUR NOTABILITY FILES! This program is primarily made just for me, I cannot gauarentee it will work for an average joe

This project is a huge hard coded hack to automatically sync pdf files to notability. (works on linux and doesn't deserialize NSKeyedArchive encoded files; instead, it directly modifies them)

## Usage
forgot how to setup everything. you probably need (python) dependencies installed, good fucking luck. Probably do this in venv.

## Docs
see code.
